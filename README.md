## Purpose
This analysis of bike-sharing data in New York City to purpose a bike-sharing program in Des Moines, Iowa.  The analysis looks at different features in the data such as trip duration, gender, time of day, location and utilization.  Since Des Moines has differences from New York the data will be used to determine the features that lead to the success and hope to replicate those.

## Results

## Summary

This analysis shows that the features that contribute to success of bike-sharing are a compact city center where bikes could be a more attractive mode of transportation for customer as well as a population that will utilize bikes as their main form of transportation to and from work.

### Future Analysis
- Analysis of gender by age would be helpful in determining if this is a factor in the difference in the number of male and female customers.
- Analysis of trip duration and trip numbers at different months throughout the year to see the difference in usage based on seasons and weather.

An analysis of Des Moines population will also need to be completed to determine if some of the key features to success can be duplicated to support a bike-sharing company.
